According to the report, one of the major drivers for this market is Reduction in TCO. For traditional on-site security software, TCO includes a high upfront software license cost and software implementation cost coupled with a high maintenance cost. In the case of cloud, cloud vendors are responsible for the implementation, maintenance, updates, and backup of software, thereby reducing the need for internal IT administration. In addition, the pricing model of cloud-based payroll software is based on the pay-per-use model, where customers pay according to their use of the services, as opposed to a traditional on-site model that requires a one-time substantial capital investment and ongoing operational costs.

We surveyed the Cloud-based Payroll Software companies, and industry experts on this industry, involving the revenue, demand, product type, recent developments and plans, industry trends, drivers, challenges, obstacles, and potential risks.
