Organ-On-Chip (OOC) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030
The global Organ-On-Chip (OOC) market was valued at US$ 62 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 187.8 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 17.2% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

An Organ-On-Chip (OOC) is a multi-channel 3-D microfluidic cell culture chip that simulates the activities, mechanics and physiological response of entire organs and organ systems, a type of artificial organ. It constitutes the subject matter of significant biomedical engineering research, more precisely in bio-MEMS. The convergence of labs-on-chips (LOCs) and cell biology has permitted the study of human physiology in an organ-specific context, introducing a novel model of in vitro multicellular human organisms. One day, they will perhaps abolish the need for animals in drug development and toxin testing. Organ-On-Chip technology not only incorporates multiple cell types but also involves engineering aspects, such as the guided spatial confinement of cells or the incorporation of sensors and microfluidic channels. The primary focus of Organ-On-Chip technology is the re-creation of three key aspects of human physiology: the multicellular vascular or epithelial interfaces of organs (for example, blood vessel networks, lung and gut), which function as barriers in tissues; the tissue-level organization of parenchymal cells (for example, liver, heart, skeletal muscle and tumours), which are responsible for the key functional properties of an organ; and the systematic interaction of multiple organs (for example, drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination involving the gut, circulation, liver and kidney). In addition, the Blood-Brain Barrier is definitely more complex than a simple wall, controlling the passage of most solute that enters or leaves the brain. To address how this molecular sieve affects neural activity, some researchers have simulated the interaction between blood vessels and brain tissue on a series of interconnected "organ chips" when connected through this Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) model. Endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes and neurons alter their gene expression. These technologies will achieve even more rapid development and application.
