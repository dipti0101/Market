Semiconductor Abatement Equipment Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029
The global Semiconductor Abatement Equipment market was valued at US$ million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ million by 2029, at a CAGR of % during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

The semiconductor industry uses gases that are toxic, flammable and even harmful for the environment, but also for humans. For example, in the production of microchips. According to national legislation, these gases have to be abated. This means that they are reduced below the respective threshold limit value (TLV). Different gases require different treatment technologies, such as thermal, wet or even a combination of both technologies. The process exhaust gases can then be released into the atmosphere, without harming nature, for a greener world.
