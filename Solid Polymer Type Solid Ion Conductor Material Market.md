The solid polymer-type solid ion conductor material is an electrolyte material with a solid structure, which is composed of a polymer matrix and an ion transport agent. The polymer matrix provides the structural support of the material, while the ion transport agent forms ion channels in the polymer matrix, allowing the transport of ions within the material. These ion channels can be formed by the polymer interchain space or side chains, or by adding ion transport agents. Due to their solid-state structure and high chemical stability, solid polymer-based solid ion conductor materials are widely used in batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and other fields.
