The global N-Methylformamide (NMF) market was valued at US$ 58 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 70 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 2.9% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

N-Methylformamide NMF CAS 123-39-7 is a colorless, nearly odorless, organic compound with molecular formula CH3NHCHO, which is a liquid at room temperature. It is infinitely soluble in water. NMF is mainly used as a reagent in various organic syntheses with limited applications as a highly polar solvent. NMF is closely related to other formamides, notably formamide and dimethylformamide (DMF). However, industrial use and production of NMF are far less than for either of these other formamides. DMF is favored over NMF as a solvent due to its greater stability.
