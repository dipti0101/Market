Iron cobalt soft magnetic alloy refers to iron-cobalt binary or ternary soft magnetic alloy with high saturation magnetic induction. Due to the ordered structure of the iron-cobalt binary alloy, the alloy becomes brittle and difficult to process. In order to improve the processing performance, 1.4-1.8% vanadium (V) is usually added, so it is also called iron-cobalt-vanadium soft magnetic alloy. Such alloys have high saturation magnetic induction, high magnetic permeability at higher magnetic induction and high Curie temperature. However, this type of alloy also has the disadvantages of low resistivity and high eddy current loss.
