China Anti-Fire Aluminum Composite Panels Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030
The China Anti-Fire Aluminum Composite Panels market size was valued at US$ 1.28 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 1.75 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 5.4% during the forecast period 2024-2030.

Anti-Fire Aluminum Composite Panels are building materials consisting of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a non-combustible mineral core, designed to provide fire resistance while maintaining the aesthetic and lightweight properties of standard aluminum composite panels.

China's Anti-Fire Aluminum Composite Panels market is experiencing robust growth, driven by stringent fire safety regulations in construction and increasing awareness of building safety. In 2023, China produced 180 million square meters of anti-fire aluminum composite panels, with 75% consumed domestically and 25% exported. The commercial building sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 55% of demand, followed by residential high-rises at 25% and industrial facilities at 15%. The market is benefiting from rapid urbanization and the government's focus on fire-safe building materials, which drove a 15% increase in adoption for new construction projects in 2023. Technological advancements focus on improving fire resistance while reducing weight, with new core materials offering up to 2 hours of fire resistance at 30% lower weight compared to 2020 standards. The market is seeing a shift towards panels with enhanced thermal insulation properties, growing at 8% annually due to energy efficiency requirements. In 2023, the Chinese government introduced new fire safety standards for high-rise buildings, leading to a 20% increase in retrofitting projects using anti-fire panels. The market faces challenges from competition with other fire-resistant materials, but the versatility and aesthetic appeal of aluminum composite panels continue to drive preference in architectural applications. Research into recyclable and eco-friendly anti-fire panels is emerging as a promising field, with bio-based core materials growing at 15% CAGR, albeit from a small base. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from the increasing focus on sustainable urban development, with green building certifications driving demand for panels with both fire resistance and environmental credentials, projected to grow at 12% CAGR through 2030. The integration of smart technologies, such as embedded sensors for fire detection, in anti-fire panels is also gaining traction, with pilot projects increasing by 25% in 2023 compared to the previous year.
