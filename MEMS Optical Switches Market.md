The global MEMS Optical Switches market was valued at US$ 125.5 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 145.2 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 2.1% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

The most direct understanding of optical switch is a device used to open or close an optical circuit. It consists of mechanical, optomechanical, or electronic types. In a network, we usually require protection switching to complete or break an optical path. The key attributes must operate reliably after a long period in one position, system monitoring, and diagnosis commonly feature these devices. An optical switch has one or more inputs ports and two or more output ports that we usually call 3xN or NxN optical switch.

According to the differences of fabrication process and technologies, optical switches can be divided into mechanical optical switch, MEMS(Microelectromechanical System) optical switch and other switches. The first two switch types are the most widely used products in the market nowadays. In addition, thermo-optic switch, electro-optic switch and acousto-optic optical switch are also used in some specific applications.

MEMS optical switch is a micro-optical switch that made of the semiconductor material, which is generally used as movable micro-mirrors that can deflect optical signals from input to output fibers. It embraces the advantages as compact, lightweight and easy to expand. Besides, it shares the merits of both the mechanical optical switch and wave guide optical switch. Since EMES combines the electrical, mechanical and optical integration as a whole, it can apparently transmit different rates and different business services. MEMS switches feature good scalability.

Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) optical switch has attracted wide attention because of their versatility. MEMS optical switch can be considered as a subcategory of optomechanical switches. But due to the difference of fabrication processes and its unique miniature nature, its characteristics, performance and reliability concerns are different with the optomechanical switch. The most obvious point is the optomechanical switch has more bulk compared to other alternatives, but the MEMS optical switch overcomes this.
