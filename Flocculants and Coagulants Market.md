Flocculant and coagulant are important chemicals used in water and wastewater treatment processes for solids removal, water clarification, lime softening, sludge thickening, and solids dewatering.

Flocculation is the process where a chemical agent (flocculant) is used to reduce the turbidity of a liquid by binding suspended particles in the liquid together to form larger particles (flocs) that are heavy enough to settle to the bottom of the liquid. There are mainly three types of flocculants: Inorganic Flocculant, Organic Flocculant, and Composite Flocculant and Microbial Flocculant etcâ€¦ Subdivision into the specific product included: AS, PAC, PFS and PAM etc. In addition, most inorganic flocculants are considered as coagulants and flocculants at the same time. For this, there is no significant difference in the use of inorganic flocculants.
