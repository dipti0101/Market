Electric motor is a machine that transforms or converts electric energy to mechanical energy. Majority of electric motors operate by the internal interaction of magnetic field and winding currents to generate force within the motor. Electric motor finds its major application in the field of industrial fans, machine tools, blowers and pumps, household appliances, disk drives, and machine tools. Generally, electric motor is powered by AC current (power grid, inverters or generators) or direct current (batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers). Recently various industrial plants have started shifting from gas turbines to electric motors as an alternative source of energy. Energy efficiency is the major factor that has forced the industrial sectors to take such a step. In addition, there is observable transition in the vehicle industry from a phase of traditional vehicles to electric vehicles in various developed and developing countries including U.S., France, Germany, China, Japan and India. The major factor that drives this transition is stringent government regulations that are enforced for reducing the overall greenhouse effect from the environment.
