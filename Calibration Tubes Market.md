Report Overview

Calibration tubes are used for rehabilitation of non-accessible sewer lines. Calibration tube is also known as cal tube, calibration hose and balloon. The Calibration tube is a non-extensible and reinforced tube. Primarily, the tube is used to keep the liner inflated until cured, once cured, the tube discarded. By placing the tube in the manhole during the relining process, liner expansion can be avoided. The Calibration tube is inserted till a non-accessible point during the double liner method. Firstly a liner (not closed at both ends) is inserted and positioned in the sewer. Then the Calibration tube (closed at one end) is inserted into the liner and inflated so the liner gets fixed to the pipe tightly.
