Semiconductor Foundry Service Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2031
The global Semiconductor Foundry Service market was valued at US$ 116700 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 195590 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 7.7% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Foundry, a business model of the semiconductor industry, specializes in semiconductor wafer manufacturing, and is commissioned by other IC design companies instead of their own designs.

The foundry mode is divided into Pure-play Foundry mode and IDM Foundry. The Pure-play Foundry doesnâ€™t do design. They mainly make products for fabless company. The business scope of IDM manufacturers covers various links such as IC design, IC manufacturing, packaging and testing, and even extends to downstream electronic terminals.
