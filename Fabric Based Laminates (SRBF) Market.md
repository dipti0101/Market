China Fabric Based Laminates (SRBF) Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030
The China Fabric Based Laminates (SRBF) market size was valued at US$ 725.3 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 982.6 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 5.2% during the forecast period 2024-2030.

Fabric Based Laminates (SRBF - Silicone Resin Bonded Fabric) are composite materials made by impregnating fabric (usually cotton or glass) with silicone resin, offering excellent electrical insulation, mechanical strength, and heat resistance for various industrial applications.

China's Fabric Based Laminates (SRBF) market is experiencing steady growth, driven by expanding electrical and electronics industries and increasing demand for high-performance insulation materials. In 2023, China produced 210,000 metric tons of SRBF laminates, with 70% consumed domestically and 30% exported. The electrical equipment sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 55% of demand, followed by automotive at 25% and aerospace at 15%. The market benefited from China's investments in grid infrastructure upgrades, which led to a 18% increase in demand for high-voltage insulation materials in 2023. Technological advancements have improved the thermal index and mechanical properties of SRBF, with new grades offering a 25% increase in heat resistance compared to 2020 versions. The market is seeing strong growth in thin SRBF laminates (< 0.5mm), increasing at 7% annually, driven by miniaturization trends in electronics. In 2023, new energy efficiency standards for electrical equipment led to a 30% increase in adoption of high-performance SRBF in transformer manufacturing. The industry faces challenges from raw material price fluctuations, with silicone resin costs varying by up to 15% in 2023. However, innovations in resin formulations are helping to optimize cost-performance ratios. Emerging applications in electric vehicle battery insulation are showing promise, growing at 20% CAGR, albeit from a small base of 4% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from the rapid expansion of China's renewable energy sector, with specialized SRBF laminates for solar inverters and wind turbine components projected to grow at 10% CAGR through 2030. The development of halogen-free flame retardant SRBF is also gaining traction, with these environmentally friendly alternatives seeing a 40% increase in R&D investments in 2023.
