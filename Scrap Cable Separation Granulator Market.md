E-waste is the fastest growing segment of the waste stream. Much of the e-waste generated is sent to landfills and incinerators. Cables and wires are an integral part of the electrical and electronics industry and consist of plastic, aluminum and copper. Cables are often recycled once electronic equipment reaches the end of their useful life. Waste cables are an important source of raw materials for non-ferrous metal content. It helps restore metal content for economic and ecological reasons. Recycling of these metals reduces the danger of global warming. Companies in the wire and cable recycling market are focused on recycling and recycling e-waste generated across the globe. They segregate and recycle electronic components after they have been disposed of. Increased global warming and rising volumes of waste and scrap are some of the key reasons for wire and cable recycling. Furthermore, the existing nature of wire and cable recycling is driving the global market. Companies should invest in R&D to optimize energy consumption to recycle insulation in the wire and cable industry. The use of wire and cable in the electronics industry is inevitable and is expected to continue to grow substantially in the near future. Various types of wires and cables with different material compounds are used as conductive and insulating materials. Essentially, the stranded wire in the core wire is valuable as a secondary raw material due to its high metal content. In most cases, the various materials in a cable or flexible cord adhere very tightly to each other. Recovery techniques are required to expose and process these fractions producing small particle sizes for optimal separation. Hence, the favorable characteristics of wire and cable recycling, especially in the application to extract valuable metals, is expected to drive the growth of the wire and cable recycling market over the forecast period.
