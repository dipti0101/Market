The global RF-over-Fiber (RFoF) Solutions market was valued at US$ 429.8 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 766.4 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

RF-over-Fiber is a technology that describes the conversion of a Radio Frequency (RF) signal into a Fiber Optic (FO) signal and then back to an RF signal. In RF-over-Fiber architecture, a data-carrying RF (Radio Frequency) signal with a high frequency (usually greater than 10 GHz is imposed on a lightwave signal before being transported over the optical link. Therefore, wireless signals are optically distributed to base stations directly at high frequencies and converted from the optical to electrical domain at the base stations before being amplified and radiated by an antenna. As a result, no frequency up/down conversion is required at the various base stations, thereby resulting in simple and rather cost-effective implementation is enabled at the base stations.
