The global Water Bath market was valued at US$ 1533.6 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 2138.1 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 4.9% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Water baths are laboratory equipment that are used to incubate or maintain samples at a constant temperature over long periods of time. They consist of a metal container that is filled with heated water. For temperature regulation, these water baths either have an analog interface or a digital one. One major drawback of water baths is that they can only be used for samples that require temperatures up to 99.9?C, as water starts to boil beyond 100?C. For applications that call for temperatures above 100?C, alternative equipment such as oil baths, sand baths, or silicone baths are used.
