The reducer of construction machinery is a mechanical component used for heavy construction equipment to transfer the power of the engine or motor to the wheels or tracks of the machine. The retarder is also commonly referred to as the final drive, the travel motor, or the track drive. The reducer of construction machinery consists of a series of gears, bearings and shafts, which are installed in a solid housing. The gears are designed to mesh with each other and transmit power from the input shaft to the output shaft at a specific speed and torque ratio. The retarder also allows the operator to control the speed and direction of the machine by shifting gears.
