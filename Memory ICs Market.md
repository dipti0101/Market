A memory IC is an integrated circuit made out of millions of capacitors and transistors that can store data or can be used to process code. Memory chips can hold memory either temporarily through random access memory (RAM), or permanently through read only memory (ROM). Read only memory contains permanently stored data that a processor can read but cannot modify. Memory chips comes in different sizes and shapes. Some can be connected directly while some need special drives. Memory chips are essential components in computer and electronic devices in which memory storage plays a key role.
