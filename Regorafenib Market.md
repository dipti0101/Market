FDA Approval:

Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, GIST after disease progression, and hepatocellular carcinoma after other treatments.
Indications:

Used for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Administration:

It is an oral medication taken once daily for 21 days followed by a 7-day rest period in a 28-day cycle.
Side Effects:

Common side effects include fatigue, hand-foot skin reactions, diarrhea, high blood pressure, and liver toxicity.
Targeted Therapy:
