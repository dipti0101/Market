Due to the rapid development of the wind power and photovoltaic industry, as well as the increasing awareness of environmental protection in various countries, the energy storage industry is becoming one of the key technologies, which is used in many countries to advance the carbon neutral target process today. The United States, China and Japan occupied the leading position in the installed capacity of energy storage projects, among which the United States is the world's largest energy storage market. The European Union established the European Battery Alliance (EBA) in 2017, aiming to escape the EU's dependence on Asian manufacturers in the battery storage field. According to Data Europa?s statistics, the cumulative installed capacity has reached 48.38GW in 2020. At present, pumped storage accounts for 94% of the energy storage market in Europe, with Spain and Germany having the largest capacity. According to BNEF data, electrochemical energy storage in the United States added 3.97GW / 10.88 GWh in 2021. In terms of power, it accounted for 40% of the global increase. In 2022, the United States passed the IRA, which subsidized independent energy storage for the first time. Under the ITC, new energy storage projects could offset up to 59% of the investment. The effect of the policy has initially appeared, and the energy storage industry in the United States shows an upward trend.
