Beer and wine manufacturers continue to look for advanced solutions to meet safety standards and increase productivity to meet the changes in consumer demand for beer and wine. Key beer and wine manufacturers are mostly focused on increasing the level of efficiency to grow their level of volumes for the production of beer. Brewers who seek raw material cost savings or use of local raw materials may source under-modified malts or increase the ration of adjunct. However, the limiting factor is to ensure an adequate complex of enzymatic activities for high-quality wort. Thus, with the intent of increasing efficiency and optimize raw material usage, many brewers are now focused on commercial enzymes to shorten the production time, increase capacity, and for the use of raw material alternatives to malt.
