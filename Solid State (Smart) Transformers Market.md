The global Solid State (Smart) Transformers market was valued at US$ 112.5 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 241.1 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 11.5% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

The solid-state transformer (SST) was conceived as a replacement for the conventional power transformer, with both lower volume and weight. The smart transformer (ST) is an SST that provides ancillary services to the distribution and transmission grids to optimize their performance. Hence, the focus shifts from hardware advantages to functionalities. One of the most desired functionalities is the dc connectivity to enable a hybrid distribution system. For this reason, the ST architecture shall be composed of at least two power stages. The standard design procedure for this kind of system is to design each power stage for the maximum load.
