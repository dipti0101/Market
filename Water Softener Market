Water Softeners, also often referred to as water softening systems or water softening equipment, can be defined as devices that are installed for the treatment and conversion of hard water into soft water at the Point of Entry (PoE) of water from public sources into households or the commercial or industrial units.

Water softening is the removal of magnesium and calcium minerals from your water supply through a process of ion-exchange. The softened water that’s then produced is kinder to skin, doesn’t leave limescale buildup on pipes, appliances or any surfaces around your home; meaning it shines for longer.

At the heart of a water softener are two cylinders containing resin. Millions of microscopic beads trap hardness minerals, softening the water as it enters your home. The resin requires regular cleaning (regeneration), which is a process a water softener performs automatically. This regeneration uses block salt, which is manually topped up when needed.
