When it comes to an electric stacker, there are several important drivers to consider. These drivers can greatly impact the functionality, efficiency, and safety of the stacker in material handling operations. Some key drivers for an electric stacker include:

Load Capacity: The load capacity is a crucial driver for an electric stacker. It refers to the maximum weight that the stacker can safely lift and transport. The stacker should have a load capacity that matches the requirements of the specific application, considering the weight of the loads typically handled.

Lift Height: The lift height is an important driver for an electric stacker. It refers to the maximum height that the stacker can raise the load. The stacker should be able to reach the required lift height for the specific application, considering factors such as storage rack heights and any height limitations within the workspace.

Battery Capacity and Runtime: The battery capacity and runtime are drivers that affect the stacker's operation time and efficiency. The stacker should have a battery with a capacity that allows for continuous and sufficient operation during the typical work shift without frequent recharging. The runtime should align with the operational needs to ensure uninterrupted material handling tasks.

Maneuverability: Maneuverability is a driver that impacts the stacker's ease of use and efficiency. The stacker should be designed for smooth and precise maneuvering in different working environments, including narrow aisles or confined spaces. Features like adjustable steering controls, responsive braking systems, and compact dimensions can enhance maneuverability.

Safety Features: Safety features are crucial drivers for an electric stacker. The stacker should be equipped with safety features such as overload protection, emergency stop buttons, horns, and lights for visibility. Operator controls and ergonomic design should also prioritize the safety and well-being of the operators, reducing the risk of accidents or injuries during operation.

Maintenance and Serviceability: Maintenance and serviceability are drivers that impact the stacker's durability and longevity. The stacker should be designed to allow for easy and efficient maintenance, with accessible components, regular service points, and user-friendly diagnostic systems. Good serviceability helps minimize downtime and ensures optimal performance.

Additionally, factors such as cost-effectiveness, compatibility with industry standards, and environmental sustainability can also be drivers to consider when selecting an electric stacker. It is recommended to consult with stacker manufacturers or material handling experts for guidance in choosing an electric stacker that best aligns with specific operational needs and requirements.
