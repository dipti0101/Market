The global Powder Coating market was valued at US$ 11860 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 14180 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 2.6% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Powder coating is a type of coating that is applied as a free-flowing, dry powder. The main difference between a conventional liquid paint and a powder coating is that the powder coating does not require a solvent to keep the binder and filler parts in a liquid suspension form. The coating is applied electrostatically and is then cured under heat to allow it to flow and form a ?skin?. The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint.
