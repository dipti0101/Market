According to the report, growing nutrient pollution will be a key driver for market growth. Nutrient pollution is caused by the availability of the excess nitrogen and phosphorus in the air and water. Most of these nutrients are part of our natural ecosystems. Almost 78% of the air humans breathe is nitrogen, making it the most abundant element in the air. Though humans do not directly absorb nitrogen element via air, its percentage intake is increasing in humans through the food supply chain. The nitrogen percentage in water sources is increasing due to human activities.

We surveyed the Water Quality Sensor manufacturers, suppliers, distributors and industry experts on this industry, involving the sales, revenue, demand, price change, product type, recent development and plan, industry trends, drivers, challenges, obstacles, and potential risks.
