Fish Paper, also known as vulcanized fiber, is a cellulose-based electrical insulation material known for its high dielectric strength, flexibility, and durability. It is widely used in electrical and electronic applications for insulation and mechanical protection.

China's Fish Paper market is experiencing moderate growth, driven by steady demand in traditional electrical applications and emerging uses in sustainable packaging. In 2023, China produced 45,000 metric tons of fish paper, with 80% consumed domestically and 20% exported. The electrical equipment sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 55% of demand, followed by automotive at 25% and consumer electronics at 15%. The market benefited from China's continued investments in electrical infrastructure, which led to a 10% increase in demand for fish paper in transformer and switchgear manufacturing in 2023. Technological advancements have improved the material's moisture resistance and thermal stability, with new grades offering 20% better performance in high-humidity environments compared to 2020 versions. The market is seeing growth in thin fish paper (< 0.2mm), increasing at 6% annually, driven by miniaturization trends in electronics. In 2023, new regulations promoting biodegradable materials led to a 15% increase in adoption of fish paper as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic in certain packaging applications. The industry faces challenges from competition with synthetic insulation materials, but fish paper's unique combination of electrical and mechanical properties continues to secure its position in specific applications. Emerging uses in electric vehicle battery insulation are showing promise, growing at 12% CAGR, albeit from a small base of 2% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from the growing trend of sustainable manufacturing, with fish paper being explored as a renewable alternative to petroleum-based insulation materials in various industries. This segment is projected to grow at 8% CAGR through 2030. The development of flame-retardant fish paper formulations is also gaining traction, with R&D investments in this area increasing by 25% in 2023 compared to the previous year.
