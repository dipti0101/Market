China Bio-based Synthetic Fibers Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030
The China Bio-based Synthetic Fibers market size was valued at US$ 3.25 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 5.18 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 8.1% during the forecast period 2024-2030.

Bio-based Synthetic Fibers are man-made fibers derived from renewable biological resources such as plants or biomass, offering a more sustainable alternative to traditional petroleum-based synthetic fibers while maintaining similar performance characteristics.

China's Bio-based Synthetic Fibers market is experiencing strong growth, driven by increasing environmental awareness and government initiatives promoting sustainable materials. In 2023, China produced 1.85 million metric tons of bio-based synthetic fibers, with 70% consumed domestically and 30% exported. The textile and apparel industry remains the largest consumer, accounting for 65% of demand, followed by automotive textiles at 15% and home furnishings at 12%. The market benefited significantly from China's 14th Five-Year Plan emphasis on bio-economy, which led to a 28% increase in investments in bio-based material production facilities in 2023. Technological advancements have improved fiber quality and production efficiency, with new bio-based polyester fibers achieving properties comparable to traditional PET, while reducing carbon footprint by 40%. The market is seeing rapid growth in bio-based nylon fibers, increasing at 12% annually, driven by demand in performance apparel and sustainable fashion sectors. In 2023, new regulations promoting recycled and bio-based materials in textiles led to a 35% increase in adoption by major apparel brands. The industry faces challenges from higher production costs compared to conventional synthetics, with bio-based fibers typically commanding a 15-25% price premium. However, economies of scale and improving technologies are gradually narrowing this gap. Research into novel feedstocks, such as agricultural waste and algae, is emerging as a promising field, with these next-generation bio-based fibers growing at 20% CAGR, albeit from a small base of 2% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from the growing trend of circular economy in textiles, with bio-based and recyclable fibers projected to account for 30% of all synthetic fiber production in China by 2030. The development of bio-based fibers with enhanced functional properties, such as moisture management and antimicrobial features, is also gaining traction, with R&D investments in this area increasing by 40% in 2023 compared to the previous year.
