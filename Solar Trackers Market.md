The global Solar Trackers market was valued at US$ 218.1 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 666.8 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 17.3% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Solar trackers are utilized to move photovoltaic panels toward the sun to utilize more sunlight. They enable solar modules to remain in the best position to accumulate maximum energy from the sun. The application of tracking technology allows solar panels to follow the movement of the sun and increase electricity production as compared to a stationary array. Solar trackers are attached to solar panels to adjust their positioning against the daily passage of the sun throughout the year as the weather and seasons change.
