Crystal material is widely used in lasers. Crystals used in laser is laser crystal. Laser crystals are made from mono crystalline material which is used as an active gain medium in solid state laser systems. The laser gain medium is used to amplify the power of light. Such a gain medium is required in the laser to compensate for resonator losses. The optical properties of a given crystal are determined by the crystal?s composition which decides the optimal application or laser type for that crystal.
